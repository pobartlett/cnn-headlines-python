# cnn-headlines-python
A short Python script to pull the top X headlines from cnn.com

Should work on linux command line (python headlines.py <# of headlines>), not tested on Windows

Feel free to use this in any way you like, all I ask is that you link to this repository (https://github.com/pobartlett/cnn-headlines-python)
